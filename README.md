# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. The project will use Business Intelligence (BI) algorithms to analyze the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. 

# Models used
1.	Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. In this project, we will use logistic regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the dataset's features.
2.	UnderSampling: Undersampling is a technique used to balance an imbalanced dataset by reducing the number of samples in the majority class. In this project, we will use undersampling to reduce the number of non-fraudulent transactions to balance the dataset with fraudulent transactions. This will help prevent the algorithm from being biased towards the majority class.
3.	Decision Tree: A decision tree is a classification algorithm that works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the features. In this project, we will use a decision tree to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the dataset's features.
4.	Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and outputs the average prediction of each tree. In this project, we will use a random forest to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the dataset's features.

# Output Visualization in Kaggle
We will visualize the results using the following methods in Kaggle:
•	Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix will be used to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithms. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
•	ROC Curve: ROC curves will be used to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithms. The ROC curve shows the true positive rate versus the false positive rate at different classification thresholds.
•	Scatter Plots: Scatter plots will be used to visualize the decision boundary of the classification algorithms. The scatter plot shows the distribution of transactions based on two selected features and the decision boundary created by the algorithm.

# Conclusion
In this project, we explored various BI algorithms for credit card fraud detection, including logistic regression, undersampling, decision tree, and random forest. We used the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which is highly imbalanced. We balanced the dataset using undersampling and evaluated the performance of the algorithms using the confusion matrix and ROC curve. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that the random forest algorithm performed the best for this dataset, with an accuracy of 99.92% and an AUC score of 0.97. Logistic regression
